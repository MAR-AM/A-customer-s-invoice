# A-customer-s-invoice
We wish to establish invoices for 3 customers whose names we know. We assume that each of them purchased a single item .The invoice will show the customer's name and the amount including tax, knowing that a rate of 15% VAT and the customer benefits from a 2% discount on the amount of these purchases.
